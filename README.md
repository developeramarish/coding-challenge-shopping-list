# coding-challenge-shopping-list

## Brief
We want to have a web service in either MVC or Web API that will enable us
to populate a shopping list for our office. So here is how we want you to
create it:

### 1- Service Endpoint
Create an endpoint which will be accessible through a friendly route.
(This can be hosted on your localhost at least for now).

The endpoint will work based on the following web requests:
* Http Post request should adding a drink in to the list with quantity e.g. name of drink (Pepsi) and quantity (1)
* Http Put request for updating a drinks quantity
* Http Delete request for removing a drink from the shopping list
* Http Get request for retrieving a drink by its name and its quantity so we can see how many ordered
* Http Get request for retrieving full list of what we have in the shopping list

Notes:
* This doesn’t have to use database you can use in memory solution to hold the shopping list. Any thing simple that works
* Ideally it should contain one unique drink name for each entry to avoid repetitions
* Please feel free to implement/explain any advanced features to demonstrate your skills and experience such as paginated lists api authorisation and validation etc.

### 2- Service Client
We have a web api client library at GitHub repository
[here](https://github.com/CKOTech/checkout-net-library). We want you to modify this library so that it can interact with the shopping list endpoint that
will be created so that it can act as a client for the endpoint.

Please upload both solutions on Github and send us the link, thanks.
